# Sass-7-1
Batch, SH and main.scss file to prepare dev environment

## What's the aim ?  
I like using Sass, but preparing development environment takes a lot of time (to me).
I had to look for the commands, and the syntax, etc.
I decided to create a .sh file (for Linux) and a .bat file (for Windows) to create the 7-1 file structure and the files inside.

## TO DO :
Add a "How to" install Sass, from zero to "everything is ok, go on coding".
